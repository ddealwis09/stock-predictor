    "- A Docker image is a standalone, lightweight, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, such as the application code, system tools, libraries, and settings.\n",
    "- Docker images make it easier for developers to package, distribute, and run applications, regardless of the underlying infrastructure:\n",
    "    - Portability: Docker images are platform-independent and can be run on any host that supports Docker, making it easy to move applications between different environments without compatibility issues.\n",
    "    - Consistency: Docker images provide a standardized, reproducible environment for running applications, ensuring that they behave the same way on different machines.\n",
    "    - Efficiency: Docker images are lightweight and take up minimal disk space, making them easy to distribute and deploy.\n",
    "    - Isolation: Docker containers provide a level of isolation between the application and the host operating system, which can improve security and prevent conflicts with other software running on the same machine."

    "- a virtual machine is a fully isolated virtualized environment that emulates a complete computer system, including its own operating system, hardware, and resources.\n",
    "    - Overhead: Containers have lower overhead compared to VMs since they share the host operating system kernel and only require the resources needed to run the application. VMs require their own copy of the operating system, which adds significant overhead and can slow down performance.\n",
    "    - Isolation: Containers are isolated at the application level, while VMs are isolated at the hardware level. This means that containers can be more lightweight and portable, while VMs offer stronger isolation and security.\n",
    "    - Portability: Containers are more portable since they can run on any host that supports the container runtime, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system. VMs require a hypervisor or virtualization software that supports the specific hardware and operating system."
