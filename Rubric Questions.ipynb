    "- The main advantage of Prophet is its simplicity and ease of use. It requires minimal data preprocessing and can handle missing data and outliers in a robust manner. It also provides good results with a relatively small amount of training data, making it a good choice for many real-world forecasting problems at scale."

The idea behind exponential smoothing is to assign exponentially decreasing weights to older observations as they become less relevant for forecasting future points. The most recent observations carry the most weight in the forecast, while older observations are given decreasingly smaller weights."

    "- Stationarity is a property of a time series data where the statistical properties, such as mean and variance, remain constant over time. In other words, a stationary time series has a consistent pattern and does not exhibit trends or seasonality.\n",
    "- Seasonality is a repeating pattern in a time series data that occurs over a fixed time period, such as daily, weekly, or yearly. Seasonality can be observed in many time series, such as sales data, temperature data, or stock prices, and is an important factor to consider when forecasting future points.\n",
    "- Stationarity is important in time series forecasting because many statistical methods, including exponential smoothing and ARIMA, assume that the time series data is stationary. This is because stationary time series are easier to model and make predictions for, as they do not exhibit trends or seasonality.\n",
    "- In non-stationary time series, the mean and variance change over time, making it difficult to make accurate predictions. To address this, the non-stationary time series must be transformed into a stationary time series through a process known as differencing.\n",
